# CS-300-Final-Project
Final project for the SNHU course Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design, CS 300

### 1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem was creating a data structure to hold course information. The user also needed to be able to access information about a specific course, sort the courses, and print all the courses.

### 2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I considered the pros and cons of using different data structures, because each has its tradeoffs. Some are memory-efficient, while others allows for the quick access of specifc elements at the cost of memory. I chose the tree data structure, because it offered the benefits of quick access of elements, flexible memory allocation, and the fact that elements were always sorted.

### 3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I googled! Also, I looked at code from my previous assignemts and milestones, copying and pasting when appropriate. The majority of the roadblocks I encountered were quirks of the previous assignment's code that I hadn't properly altered for the final project. Beyond simply reading the compiler error, I would tiptoe through the code and print the values of variables at different lines of execution. When the printed values differed from what I expected, or they weren't printed at all, I could narrow down where the problem was.

### 4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I have become much more familair with programming in C++, and this has allowed me to focus on higher level thinking about the project as a whole. C++ is more explicit and hides less abstraction than a language like Python. This means that my thinking is more geared toward the processes that a computer goes through, rather than how to write the correct syntax to get a desired output. Also, considering the pros and cons of different data structures and analyzing the efficiency of each has made me think more deeply about the variety of ways to solve problems.

### 5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I learned the value of using comments to explain the code. Initially, I only did this because it was a criteria of grading, but I soon realized its benefit. For example, a good summary of what a function does can help one reason about the design of a program much more easily. At higher levels of thought, this better enables ones to think only of the essentials. Related is the logical naming of functions and variables, because sometimes the code can expalin itself without the need for comments.
